Encryption is by many considered a science, a science of writing a text that would be imperceptibly by the adversary. Ever since the man felt the need to protect his ideas or even the information he shared, such as in wartime, it was important that an order of attack or movement was not intercepted because it could compromise the same movement. Nowadays encryption has become something that is not just for military purposes.

SecuriText was a team project for my computer security subject at University. We made a secure text editor that can encrypt and decrypt any file with RC4 (Rivest Cipher 4), 3DES (Triple Data Encryption Standart) and AES (Advanced Encryption Standart). It can also sign files and create certificates. The application was programmed entirely in Python and the interface was designed using Python’s GTK.
