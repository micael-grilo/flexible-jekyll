Monitoring the health status of patients is a key task in hospitals. Medical staff regularly verify and analyze the health parameters of the patients to follow their evolution. This project presents a proposal of a Web application for real-time and remote monitoring using body sensor networks (BSNs). The BSN, in conjunction with the Web application, will allow the detection of the patient location in the ward and the continuous monitoring and analysis of their health parameters like temperature, heart rate, among others. The Web application displays the building blueprints that represent the covered area and over this plans the patients’ motion is displayed as well as their respective location in the real environment. The parameters obtained by sensors will be presented to the user in the Web application associated with the respective patient representation. The proposed solution is focused on the new and latest Web technologies allowing the application to be used in multi platforms, from desktops to mobile devices.
