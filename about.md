## Nice to meet you!!!

From a young age, computers have held my interest. I was using Linux, building and repairing computers, and teaching myself C in my teens before I began my college career in Computer Science at 19. A few years later, I completed a BSc degree in __Computer Science and Engineering__ at University of Beira Interior (UBI), Portugal. As a research assistant at UBI, I helped a team by implementing a full stack application to gather and display real-time body sensor data in a friendly and innovative dashboard and authored a paper in MITA 2014 conference.

A full-time __self-learner__, I am constantly working on my own ideas like building applications, automating boring tasks, playing with machine learning, AI, computer vision, AR and discovering the marvels of cyber security.

## Skills:
- Python, Javascript, C
- Full Stack Web / App Development
- Machine Learning / Artificial Intelligence / Chatbots
- Cryptography / Blockchain / Cyber Security
- Computer Vision / Augmented Reality
- Version control, automated testing/build/deployment.

I'm always fascinated by new challenges, especially when it comes to cutting-edge technologies. I find myself at the intersection between __creativity__ and __logic__, solving problems with a fresh and multidisciplinary approach.

I'm currently developing in __Python__ and __Javascript__ creating APIs, Backends, Front-ends, and mobile applications with __Meteor__ and __Ionic__. __MongoDB__, __Redis__, __GraphQL__ and a bunch of __Relational Databases__ are always in my mind and at the tip of my fingertips.

Always experimenting, always learning, never bored!!!  

... __KISS!__ (Keep It Simple, Stupid!).
